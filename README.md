# Introduction

This project introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed specifically for augmenting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The goal of this tool is to enhance the quality and quantity of fMRI datasets, which can be particularly useful for improving the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, regression, and anomaly detection.
