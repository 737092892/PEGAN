# Introduction
This project introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed specifically for augmenting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The goal of this tool is to enhance the quality and quantity of fMRI datasets, which can be particularly useful for improving the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, regression, and anomaly detection.
# Methodology
The proposed GAN architecture, named PE-GAN (Patch-Entirety GAN), is designed to address the challenges of generating realistic and high-quality fMRI data. PE-GAN leverages a convolutional architecture combined with two-stage attention mechanisms and symmetry constraints to ensure that the generated data retains both local and global structural consistency. This design is validated through systematic experiments comparing it with baseline GAN variants, including a fully-connected GAN and a convolutional GAN without attention or symmetry constraints.
# Dataset
The ADHD-200 dataset is used for training and evaluation. This dataset consists of multi-site fMRI data from NYU, PKU, and NI, providing a diverse and representative sample of functional brain activity. The cross-site nature of the dataset allows us to evaluate the generalization capability of the proposed method across different populations and acquisition protocols.
